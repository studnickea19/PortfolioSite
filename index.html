                    Hello. My name is Ellie, I'm 24 years old, and I'm finally getting into coding. I was born and raised in Waukesha, WI where I currently live with my boyfriend. For those of you who don't know, Waukesha is technically a suburb of Milwaukee about 30 minutes west. I attended UW-Whitewater after highschool and obtained a Bachelor's degree in English Literature. As you can imagine, it's not exactly paying the bills.

                    <p class="goals">
                    My goals for this course are to become an efficient and well-rounded developer. While I enjoy Front End the most, my personal experience has been that understanding each part of a process makes you a better team player and improves your ability to do your part. I value the Full Stack education we'll be receiving for that reason, whether or not I end up  applying all of that knowledge for my next position.
