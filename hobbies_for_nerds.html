                    <h4>The Calm and the Storm</h4>
                    <p>Let's start with the calm. For me, reading is an immersive experience so complete I've not heard my own name being called. I've stayed up until 5 am for a book, neglected to eat and sleep. Reading is my escape, my safe place. After a long day, in the midst of a stressful situation, in the event of boredom - this is where I go.<br><br>
                    If reading is the calm, writing is the storm. I don't think anyone chooses to study literature if they don't enjoy good writing. In addition, I don't think anyone who writes would misunderstand what I mean by calling it the storm. If reading is where I escape to, writing is where I come apart. When reading isn't enough to calm me down, I put pen to paper.</p>

                 <h1>Music</h1><br>
                 <p>If it were possible to be a professional Spotify-er, that's what I would be doing. I'm an all-day, all-tasks listener. Below is a list of my most important genres:<br>
                 <ol>
                    <li>Rock (Emo, Punk, 70s)</li>
                    <li>R &amp; B</li>
                    <li>Hip Hop</li>
                    <li>Rap (Kendrick Lamar is everything)</li>
                 </ol>
                 I was raised on the sound of Led Zeppelin and the car windows down, matured with the tunes of My Chemical Romance in my morning routine, and grew into my own with Beyonc√© in my headphones.
